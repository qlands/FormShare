# Assistants

{% hint style="info" %}
**Active project vs. current project**

* In FormShare, you can have one active project. The active project is marked with a star (‚≠ê) and is the one showing on the [Dashboard](../the-dashboard.md).
* The current project is displayed on the screen. It can be any project you select, including the active project.
{% endhint %}



Assistants help you collect and clean data. Assistants are created under a project (they belong to a project) but can assist in several forms and different capacities across projects.
