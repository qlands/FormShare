# Forms

FormShare is an advanced data management platform for [Open Data Kit](https://docs.getodk.org/form-design-intro/) (ODK). It works by uploading [ODK XLS/X forms](https://docs.getodk.org/xlsform/) (Excel format). Forms are allocated to one [Project](../projects.md), can have multiple assistants or assistant groups performing data collection or cleaning actions, and can be accessed by multiple [partners](../partners.md).
