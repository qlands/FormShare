**Active project vs current project**

* In FormShare you can have one active project. The active project is marked with a star (‚≠ê) and is the one showing on the [Dashboard](the-dashboard.md).
* The current project is the one displayed on the screen. This can be any project that you select including the active project.

## Assistants

Assistants help you collect and clean data. Assistants are created under a project (they belong to a project) but they can assist in several forms in different capacities across projects.
