# Assistant groups

{% hint style="info" %}


**Active project vs. current project**

* In FormShare, you can have one active project. The active project is marked with a star (‚≠ê) and is the one showing on the [Dashboard](../the-dashboard.md).
* The current project is displayed on the screen. It can be any project you select, including the active project.
{% endhint %}

Assistant groups help you organize assistants in groups. For example, you can have a data cleaners group and assign it to a form with data cleaning privileges. All the assistants of that group will be able to clean data.
