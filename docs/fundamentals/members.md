# Collaborators

Collaborators are users of FormShare that can help you manage your projects. You add collaborators to projects. A collaborator can be linked to many projects and have different access to each project.

You can access the collaborator's page in the left menu of FormShare or on the "Projects Details" page.

## Add collaborators

1\. **Roles**: Collaborators can have three different roles in a project: Members (the default) can only access forms and data in read-only mode, Editors can make modifications in forms and project details but cannot add or remove other collaborators, and Administrators can make any kind of modifications to the project, forms and its collaborators.

2\. **Current collaborators**: Each collaborator shows their role within the project. You can [change their role](members.md#add-collaborators) or [remove them](members.md#undefined).&#x20;

3\. **Search for collaborators**: You can search for collaborators by name or by email. Once you select a collaborator you can add them with the "Add collaborator" button.

4\. **Add collaborator**: Click on the "Add collaborator" button to add the collaborator to the project. By default, the collaborator will be added as a "Member" of the project.

**Note:** Depending on the ["Collaborator settings](../technical-pages/keyboard-shortcuts.md#collaborators)" FormShare will add the collaborator directly or send an email requesting the acceptance of such collaboration.&#x20;
