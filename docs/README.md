# Welcome to FormShare

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is FormShare:** FormShare is an advanced and professional data management platform for [Open Data Kit](https://docs.getodk.org/) (ODK) that handles your data in a secure, consistent, and interoperable way using technologies like [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), and [OData](https://www.odata.org/)

With FormShare you can create data collection projects, upload ODK Forms, manage submissions, perform data cleaning, create data products, and analyze data with the tools of your choice.
