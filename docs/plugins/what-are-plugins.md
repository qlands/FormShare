# What are plugins?

Plugins are modules that FormShare can load to extend its functionality. There are several plugins available in our GitHub repository. For example:

* [Enketo](https://github.com/qlands/formshare\_enketo\_plugin): This plugin allows FormShare to share ODK forms with [Enketo](https://enketo.org/) to collect data using the web browser.

The following sections explain each plugin in detail.
